## Workout Manager

For my project, I made a workout manager that allows users to create workouts that they want to do by adding exercises to a workout plan.

### Functionality

- Users can create a workout plan by adding exercises to it.
- Users can add sets and reps to each exercise.
- Users can set a goal for the workout plan, such as losing weight or increasing muscle.
- Users can view their workout plan, including the exercises and their sets and reps.
- Users can remove exercises from their workout plan that they have created.
- Workout plan will be saved when the user closes the tab or refreshes the page.
